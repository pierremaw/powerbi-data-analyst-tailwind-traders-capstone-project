# Power BI Data Analyst Capstone Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains my capstone project for the Power BI Data Analyst Certificate. The project is scenario-based and simulates a real business environment where I apply the skills and techniques I learned during the course.  

The project is designed to test my ability to translate course concepts into practical, real-world applications.  

## Final Project  
The capstone project focuses on applying Power BI in a comprehensive business setting. I was required to:  

- Use MS Excel to gather data from multiple sources, then clean, transform, and load it for further analysis.  
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and loading directly in Power BI.  
- Design and model data structures in Power BI.  
- Create DAX calculations and optimize model performance.  
- Build and enhance dashboards and reports with a focus on usability, storytelling, and uncovering trends.  
- Configure alerts for monitoring key metrics.  

This project demonstrates my ability to design a complete data analysis solution, from raw data to insights.  

## Preparation and Review  
To prepare, I:  
- Reviewed exercises and practice projects from earlier modules.  
- Focused on areas where I needed deeper understanding.  
- Revisited course materials (videos, readings, and examples) to reinforce knowledge.  

## Conclusion  
This capstone project reflects my ability to:  
- Build end-to-end Power BI solutions.  
- Apply data modeling and DAX to solve business problems.  
- Design interactive dashboards that communicate insights effectively.
